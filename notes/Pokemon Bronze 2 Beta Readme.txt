Please let me know your feedback after playing the beta!

Some things remain unfinished for now.
Gym leaders etc don't have new sprites for example.
The game ends after the elite four, no other events have been programmed past that point.
So you don't need to play any further than that.

Keep a look out for:
-Bugs
-Events out of sequence
-Spelling/grammer mistakes

And give me your feedback on:
-Game length
	Too short, long or just right?
	Factor in if you used super speed when playing.
-Game difficulty
	Too easy, hard or just right?
-How the overall game felt
	The game's intent was to feel like a real game made by Game Freak in the 2000s.
	Was this goal reached? If not, how can it better be achived?
-Did you enjoy the story?
	Did parts of it drag on, or were too brief?
	
Thank you for playing Pokemon Bronze 2!
